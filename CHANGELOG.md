All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-07

### [Added] Support for formal molecular charges
- Added a "Charge" button to place a non-bonding formal charge on the canvas.
- Charges are displayed as colored disks (red = negative, blue = positive) with the symbol centered.
- Right-click on a charge opens a dialog to edit its value (`+`, `-2`, `1`, etc.).
- Only one formal charge can exist at a time.
- New variable `self.charge_mol` is used in the total Ï€-electron count:
  ```python
  total_pi_electrons -= self.charge_mol
- Imported `simpledialog` from `tkinter`.
- Function `add_plus_if_needed(text)` to display `+x` when appropriate on charge labels.
- Optional coordinates `x`, `y` for `draw()` method in `ChargeNode`, allowing custom positioning.s

### Changed
- Default `charge` parameter in `ChargeNode.__init__` changed from `'-'` to `'-1'`.
- Charge text color is now always set to white, instead of being conditional on its sign.
- Charge drawing now uses custom coordinates (`draw_x`, `draw_y`) instead of `self.x`, `self.y`.
- Attribute `charges` replaced by `formal_charges`.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Full English `README.md` and structured documentation (`docstrings` updated).
- Support for building a standalone Linux application using PyInstaller (with an appropriately configured build script).
- Custom "About" window with logo, author details, and version info; Escape key shortcut and non-resizable design.

### Fixed
- Various bug fixes in the molecule viewer and numerical results window (scrollbars, scaling).
